# Terraform AWS Standard Fargate

## This module has moved!
Going forward, please use [the new repo](https://github.com/byu-oit/terraform-aws-fargate-api/)

If you need information about an old version of this module (e.g. for troubleshooting a previously deployed application), navigate to the specific tag. For example, v2.1.0 can be found at [https://github.com/byu-oit/terraform-aws-standard-fargate/tree/v2.1.0](https://github.com/byu-oit/terraform-aws-standard-fargate/tree/v2.1.0).

## Why did we do this?

We wanted to update the name to reflect what the module actually does, without breaking users of old versions.

As our use of Terraform has evolved, the name of this module wasn't very accurate. We wanted to rename this module to better describe its purpose.

At the same time, we didn't want to break old versions. When renaming a repo, GitHub maintains the old URLs, unless a new repo is created with the old name. Given the name of this repo, this seems unlikely...but we didn't want to risk it.

This old repo was copied to the new repo (including all history). The new repo was renamed, and the old repo was archived.
